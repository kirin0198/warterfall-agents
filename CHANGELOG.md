## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Dropped GitHub Copilot / OpenAI Codex exports; project is now Claude Code only.
  Removed `platforms/` directory (35 files, ~468 KiB), `scripts/generate.mjs`, and the Platform-Guide wiki page.
  Historical multi-platform content remains accessible in git history up to commit `0ebd78e`
  ("feat: design /maintenance-flow (4th flow for existing-project maintenance)").
- `sandbox-policy.md` simplified to Claude Code–only: removed 4-way platform detection
  (claude_code / copilot / codex / unknown), removed `advisory_only` sandbox mode.
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` moved to `.claude/rules/aphelion-overview.md` with auto-load header; the Aphelion workflow overview is now part of the auto-loaded rules collection
- `rules-designer` now writes project-specific rules to `.claude/rules/project-rules.md` instead of the project root `CLAUDE.md`

### Removed

- The project-root `CLAUDE.md` artifact from `rules-designer` output — Aphelion no longer generates it to avoid collisions with existing user `CLAUDE.md` files

### Migration

- Existing users who rely on `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: the file has been renamed to `.claude/rules/aphelion-overview.md` and is now auto-loaded by Claude Code. No manual action required if you use the CLI (`npx aphelion-agents update`).
- Existing projects with a hand-authored `CLAUDE.md` at the project root: consider moving it to `.claude/rules/project-rules.md` so it is auto-loaded alongside Aphelion rules (optional).
- CLI distribution is automatically updated to the new layout — no individual migration script execution is required.
